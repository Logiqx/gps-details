## Sailmon Observations

### Introduction

I have documented my observations of data from the Sailmon Max, so they can be fed back to the Sailmon developers.

To avoid a single lengthy document, I've documented the observations on individual pages:

- Absence of [speed data](speed.md) in GPX files
- Incorrect [timestamps](timestamps.md) in GPX files
- Levels of [precision](precision.md) in GPX + CSV files
- Approach to [filtering](filtering.md) in GPX + CSV files

The first two items (speed data and timestamps) would benefit the most from some software development, imho.

I hope that my feedback will prove useful to the developers at Sailmon.
