## Sony GNSS Chipsets

### Overview

The latest Sony GNSS chipsets are listed on their [website](https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/products/lsi-ic/gps.html).

The CXD5603GF was definitely used in Garmin watches back in 2019, but may have been superseded in newer watches.



### Watches

#### Garmin

Garmin first used the Sony GNSS chipset in 2019 and multiple teardowns show the D5603 (CXD5603GF):

- Forerunner 245 was released in Apr 2019 and uses the D5603, confirmed by iFixIt [teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Garmin+Forerunner+245+Music+Teardown/150396?srsltid=AfmBOoqg114zv10EakWr_a1-HPvIx9ZS2-FD9lbg5X57jVdyvS60z2Vz).
- fÄ“nix 6X Pro was released in Aug 2019 and uses the D5603, confirmed by F Tipi [tear down](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-6x-pro-disassembly-or-teardown-whatever-you-say/).

In addition, some of the other Garmin watches using the Sony chipset are listed by [DC Rainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/01/gps-accuracy-impacting-devices.html).



#### COROS

The APEX, VERTIX, APEX Pro and PACE 2 all use the Sony GNSS chipset:

- APEX 42 / 46 mm were released in Oct 2018.
- VERTIX was released in May 2019.
- APEX Pro was released in Sep 2019.
- PACE 2 was released in Aug 2020.

It is quite possible that they use different generations of the CXD56xxxx, and not just the CXD5603GF.
