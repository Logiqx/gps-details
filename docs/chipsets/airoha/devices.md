### Overview

The AG3335 series can be thought of as the descendants of the MediaTek MT3333.

A short [article](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/VXKPfHI9iDCvsRWN) for ION GNSS+ 2022 describes the AG3335 series.



### Chipsets

- [AG3335M](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/A0Dmm0pijWW3MScb) is multi-band (L1 + L5) but has no support the NavIC.
- AG3335MN is single-band (L1) for GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou / QZSS but it supports L5 for NavIC / IRNSS.
- [AG3352](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/zy4r082hgNywp1bg) is the new generation single-band (L1) chip on the Airoha website, which could be used in future watches.



### Watches

#### Garmin

The availability of all systems + multi-band indicates the AG3335M chipset. The AG3335MN and AG3352 chipsets do not support multi-band.

The fÄ“nix 7X uses the AG3335MN (confirmed by [teardown](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/)) and is likely to be used in other Garmin watches without multi-band in 2022.

Garmin watches since 2023 could be using either the AG3335MN or AG3352, which would be confirmed by a disassembly / teardown.



#### COROS

The availability of all systems + multi-band indicates use of the AG3335M chipset.

The PACE 3, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2, and VERTIX 2S all have multi-band so they will have the AG3335M.

The APEX 2 uses an Airoha chipset but does not have multi-band, so it could be using either the AG3335MN or AG3352.
