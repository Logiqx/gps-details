## Airoha GNSS Chipsets

### Overview

The Airoha AG3335 chipsets can be thought of as the descendants of the MediaTek MT3333.

A short [article](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/VXKPfHI9iDCvsRWN) for ION GNSS+ 2022 describes the AG3335 series.



### Chipsets

- [AG3335M](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/A0Dmm0pijWW3MScb) is multi-band (L1 + L5) but has no support the NavIC.
- AG3335MN is single-band (L1) for GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou / QZSS but it supports L5 for NavIC / IRNSS.
- [AG3352](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/zy4r082hgNywp1bg) is another single-band (L1) chip on the Airoha website, which could well be used in future watches.



### Watches

#### Garmin

The availability of all systems + multi-band is due to the Airoha AG3335M. The AG3335MN and AG3352 chipsets do not support multi-band, thus not used in watches supporting multi-band.

- The fÄ“nix 7X Solar was released in Jan 2022 and uses the AG3335MN, confirmed by the F Tipi [teardown](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/).
- The AG3335MN is likely to have been used in other non multi-band Garmin watches released in 2022.

The Garmin watches since 2023 could be using either the AG3335MN or AG3352, which will hopefully be confirmed by a disassembly / teardown.



#### COROS

The availability of all systems + multi-band indicates that COROS are using the AG3335M chipset.

The PACE 3, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2, and VERTIX 2S all have multi-band so they will be using the AG3335M.

The APEX 2 also uses an Airoha chipset but does not have multi-band, so it could be either the AG3335MN or AG3352.
