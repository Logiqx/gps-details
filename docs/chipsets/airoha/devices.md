### Overview

The AG3335 series can be thought of as the descendants of the MediaTek MT3333.

A short [article](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/VXKPfHI9iDCvsRWN) for ION GNSS+ 2022 describes the AG3335 series.



### Chipsets

- [AG3335M](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/A0Dmm0pijWW3MScb) is multi-band (L1 + L5) but has no support the NavIC.
- AG3335MN is single-band (L1) for GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou / QZSS but it supports L5 for NavIC / IRNSS.
- [AG3352](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/zy4r082hgNywp1bg) is the new generation single-band (L1) chip on the Airoha website, which could be used in future watches.



### Watches

#### Garmin

The fÄ“nix 7X uses the AG3335MN (confirmed by [tear down](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/)) and is likely to be in other Garmin watches without multi-band support in 2022.

Garmin watches since 2023 may use the AG3352 as an alternative to the AG3335MN, although this is speculative and lacking evidence!
