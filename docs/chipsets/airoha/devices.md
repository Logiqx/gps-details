### Overview

- [AG3335M](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/A0Dmm0pijWW3MScb) is multi-band (L1 + L5) but has no support the NavIC
- AG3335MN is single-band (L1) for GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou / QZSS but it supports L5 for NavIC / IRNSS.
- [AG3352](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/zy4r082hgNywp1bg) is a new generation single-band (L1) chip on the Airoha website, which could be used in future watches.



### Watches

#### Garmin

The Fenix 7X uses the AG3335MN (confirmed by [tear down](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/)) so it seems likely that it will also be in the Forerunner 165.
