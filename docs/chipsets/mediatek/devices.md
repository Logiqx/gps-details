## Mediatek GNSS Chipsets

### Overview

MediaTek GNSS chipsets are detailed on another [page](README.md) but to summarise:

- The MT3333 was [announced](https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-announces-worlds-1st-5-in-1-multi-gnss-receiver-soc-solutions-supporting-beidou-satellite-navigation-system) in January 2013.
  - It supports GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou + QZSS.
  - It was used in Garmin watches from 2013-2018.

- The MT3339 was [announced](https://corp.mediatek.com/news-events/press-releases/mediatek-announces-its-latest-gps-solution-supporting-qzss) in June 2011.
  - It supports GPS + QZSS.
  - It was potentially the MediaTek chipset used in Garmin watches during 2012, prior to the MT3333.
