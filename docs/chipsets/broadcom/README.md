### Overview

The Broadcom [website](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs) currently lists three generations of dual-frequency GNSS chipsets:

- [BCM4778](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm4778) is Broadcom's third generation dual-frequency L1 + L5 GNSS receiver, announced in Sep 2021
- [BCM47765](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm47765) is part of the BCM4776 family supporting L1 + L5, announced in Jan 2020
- [BCM47755](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm47755) is part of the BCM4775 family supporting L1 + L5, announced in Sep 2017

The [BCM47531](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm47531) is also listed which is an L1 multi-constellation chipset, announced in Dec 2013.

In addition to the four chipsets already mentioned, various other GNSS chipsets / families have been released over the years.

Since mid-2020, Synaptics have been producing chipsets such as the SYN4778, after [acquiring certain assets](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/07/2058930/0/en/Synaptics-to-Acquire-Rights-to-Broadcom-s-Wireless-IoT-Connectivity-Business.html) from Broadcom.

This document will list Broadcom's various families of GNSS chipset in reverse-chronological order.
