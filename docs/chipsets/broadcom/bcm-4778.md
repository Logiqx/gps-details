## Broadcom GNSS Chipsets

### BCM4778

The BCM4778 was announced on 22 Sep 2021 in Broadcom's [product news](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/58626) and [GPSWorld](https://www.gpsworld.com/broadcom-launches-its-lowest-power-gnss-receiver-for-mobile-wearables/). It is the third generation dual-frequency GNSS receiver from Broadcom, measuring just 2.4 mm x 2.7 mm x 0.65 mm.

The BCM4778 is listed amongst the mass-market premium family of GNSS receivers in the [GNSS and Secure SATCOM User Technology Report](https://www.euspa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/GNSS_Secure_SATCOM_User_Tech_Report.pdf) 2025 / issue 1, published by [EUSPA](https://www.euspa.europa.eu/). See page 39.

The BCM4778 is still listed as active in the list of GNSS/GPS SoCs on the Broadcom [website](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs). Further information can be found on the [product page](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm4778) and in the [product brief](https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/4778-PB1) (PDF).

Synaptics also produce the BCM4778 chipset, but it is marketed as the [SYN4778](https://www.synaptics.com/products/wireless/syn4778-multi-band-gnss). The Synaptics chipset is used in the Garmin fenix 8, clearly shown in the [teardown](https://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-8-review-but-only-the-internals/) by F Tipi in April 2025.
