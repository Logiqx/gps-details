#### BCM47758

The BCM47758 is a first generation dual-frequency GNSS chipset supporting L1 + L5. It is used in the Quectel LC29D(A) module, detailed in the [announcement](https://www.quectel.com/news-and-pr/quectel-and-broadcom-launch-dual-band-emobility-gnss-module/) and [specification](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1052/Quectel_LC29D_GNSS_Specification_V1_2-3009875.pdf) document, which shows a 1 Hz update rate. It is tailored for wearable devices according to the [product brief](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/12379501).

It is used in various Samsung products, including:

- Samsung Galaxy Watch (Aug 2018) and Galaxy Watch Active (Mar 2019) as shown in a teardown on [iFixit.com](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+Watch+Teardown/117519).

Synaptics may produce and sell the BCM47758, but calling it the [SYN47758](https://www.edomtech.com/en/product-detail/synaptics-gps-gnss-solutions/).

#### BCM47755

The [BCM47755](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs/bcm47755) is a first generation dual-frequency GNSS chipset supporting L1 + L5, now showing on the Broadcom [website](https://www.broadcom.com/products/wireless/gnss-gps-socs) as "Not Recommended for New Design". The conference paper [Android GNSS Measurements Inside the BCM47755](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329581011_Android_GNSS_Measurements_-_Inside_the_BCM47755) (Broadcom, 2018) studies the performance in Android.

The BCM47755 is used in the Quectel LC29D(C) module, detailed in the [specification](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1052/Quectel_LC29D_GNSS_Specification_V1_2-3009875.pdf) document has a 1 Hz update rate. It can also be found in the Quectel LC79D, detailed in a [product overview](https://sisoog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Quectel_GNSS_Module_Product_Overview_V3.2-1.pdf) and [product brochure](https://market.quectel.com/wp-content/uploads/custom/pdf/Quectel_Product_Brochure_CN_V6.7.pdf).

The BCM47755 appears in several Android phones, tablets, and watches:

- [Google Pixel 4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960412/) - Oct 2019
- [Samsung Galaxy Note 10](https://barbeau.medium.com/dual-frequency-gnss-on-android-devices-152b8826e1c) - Aug 2019
