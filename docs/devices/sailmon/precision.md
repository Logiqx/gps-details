## Sailmon Observations

### Precision

Most end users will not notice the precision of the data but it may still be worth review.



#### Latitude and Longitude

6 decimal places are used for latitude and longitude in the CSV and GPX files.

Roughly speaking this equates to a precision of 11.1 cm which is probably acceptable, although 7 is used more commonly.



#### Speed over Ground

The CSV file uses 6 decimal places for SOG, which equates to a precision of 1/1000 of a mm per second.

2 or 3 decimal places are the norm for speed from most GPS / GNSS applications, which exceeds the accuracy of the actual data.
