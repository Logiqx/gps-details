## Sailmon Observations

### Extensions

Just as an FYI, I'm currently involved in an initiative to extend the capabilities of GPX 1.1

Alongside the original GPX developers, we are planning to add support for data relevant to devices such as the Sailmon:

- Accuracy estimates (e.g. hAcc, vAcc, sAcc)
- IMU data (e.g. heading, pitch and roll)

The team has other initial priorities to tackle first, but I will notify you when the GPX format supports the above items.
