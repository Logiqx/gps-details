## AmazFit

### Company

Amazfit smartwatches are made by Zepp Health Corp (formerly Huami Corp), a health technology company. Zepp Health has a historical and ongoing relationship with Xiaomi as a manufacturing partner and exclusive wearable provider for Xiaomi's fitness products, such as the Mi Band series. Huami developed and manufactured many of these devices and also offers its own brand, Amazfit, while also collaborating on the Zepp Life app (formerly Mi Fit) for managing Xiaomi devices.

### Chipsets
