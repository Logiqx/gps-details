## Garmin Developer Tips

### Data Quality

#### Overview

This document is very much WIP but it captures some initial thoughts.

Consistency between applications is highly desirable, especially when it comes to calculations and filtering.

General usability is a separate topic that will be discussed on another page.



#### Thoughts from Scott Simms

How to crunch the numbers, both in apps like APPro and for official posting.

Ideally the same rules should be implemented in both cases, where possible. 

- Heading and speed data going awry  
- Missing points - that is a big deal for 1hz logging! 
- Acceptable GPS quality 
- Algorithm selection - e.g. Distance calc for Alpha gate 
- Various filters and thresholds
