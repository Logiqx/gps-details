## Garmin Developer Tips

### Data Quality

#### Overview

This document is very much WIP but it captures some initial thoughts.

Consistency between applications is highly desirable, especially when it comes to calculations and filtering.

General usability is a separate topic that will be discussed on another page.



#### Thoughts from Scott Simms

In terms of data quality issues, there will need to be some agreement, or at least communication if such decisions have already been taken, on how to handle scenarios both in apps like APPro and when crunching the numbers for official posting. I would really like to see the same rules implemented in both cases where possible. For example: 

- Heading and speed data going awry  
- Missing points - that is a big deal for 1hz logging! 
- Acceptable GPS quality 
- Algorithm selection - e.g. Distance calc for Alpha gate 
- Various filters and thresholds
