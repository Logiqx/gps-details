## Garmin Developer Tips

### Data Recording

#### Frequency

It is imperative that the data recording frequency is set to "every second" but this is the responsibility of the watch user.

It is recommended that watch apps try to determine the data recording frequency when a speed sailing activity is started.



#### Controls

The following are general recommendations:

- The user should be able to delay the recording, prior to a GPS [fix quality](fix-quality.md) of good.
- The user should be able to pause and resume sessions when taking a break.
- The user should be given the choice of saving or discarding sessions.
- The button to start / stop / pause / discard should be consistent with other Garmin activities.
