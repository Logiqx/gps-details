## Garmin Watches

### Overview

This page lists the GNSS chipsets that are used in the various Garmin watches that are used on GPS-Speedsurfing (GP3S).

Chipsets for the newer watches have typically been obtained from reviews, disassembly / teardown, testing and / or deduction.

Chipsets for the very old watches have been obtained from a variety of sources, including [fellrnr.com](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/GPS_Accuracy-summary) and [test results](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/psdyxm93y2m12j3/AABNlbBRsF2E3edvzqnnMPC4a?dl=0&preview=Test+Results+-+All+Watches.xlsx) by Mark Gee.
