## Garmin Watches

### Overview

The GNSS chipset is probably the most significant factor when it comes to the accuracy and reliability of GPS watches. Additional factors include antenna design, GNSS firmware, watch firmware, and user settings. The activity profile and / or app choice are also really important.

This page lists the GNSS chipsets of the many Garmin watches that people may wish to use for GPS-Speedsurfing (GP3S). The information is intended for people choosing a Garmin watch, or curious about the suitability of their current watch.



### Airoha GNSS Chipset

When choosing a Garmin watch it is highly recommended that you choose a model which incorporates an Airoha GNSS chipset. The speeds from the Airoha chipset are a lot more trustworthy than earlier watches, especially the ones using a Sony GNSS chipset.

There are numerous Garmin watches that incorporate the Airoha AG3335M (multi-band GNSS) or AG3335MN (single-band GNSS). The following sections list all of the Airoha-based Garmin watches that you might wish to consider for wind sports.

Disclaimer: It should be noted that not all of these watches have been tested extensively. Whilst they all use Airoha chipsets there are other factors that impact GNSS accuracy, such as the antenna design and watch firmware. Testing different watches is an ongoing activity.



#### Rugged

All of these watches include native windsurfing / kiteboarding activities, but [APPro Windsurf](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/9567700b-6587-44be-9708-879bfc844791) is strongly recommended.

#### Fitness / Fashion

None of these watches include native windsurfing / kiteboarding activities, so [APPro Windsurf](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/9567700b-6587-44be-9708-879bfc844791) is recommended.

| Series                      | Model        | Multi-Band |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | :--------: |
| [vívoactive](vivoactive.md) | vívoactive 6 |     -      |

### Recommended Apps

The following app is highly recommended, due to its features and ease of use:

- [APPro Windsurf](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/9567700b-6587-44be-9708-879bfc844791)

The following data field may be worth trying if you compete in the [GPS Team Challenge](https://www.gpsteamchallenge.com.au/):

- [GPSTC V4](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/f0f3fbd5-9de3-4d69-b89b-10b76d6a9f0f)



### Activity Profiles

If you are using a standard Garmin activity profile, it is VERY important that you use one that is suited to wind sports.

This is because the vast majority of Garmin activity profiles perform undesirable filtering of the speed data.

Several suitable activity profiles can be found on all of the rugged watches.

- Windsurf
- Kiteboard

In the absence of suitable activity profiles, you should use the generic profile.

- Other

The following is a list of activity profiles that are NOT suitable, due to their filtering / smoothing.

- Walk
- Run
- Hike
- SUP
- Surf
- Boat
- Sail



### Important Settings

- Use the best possible GNSS setting.
  - **Airoha**
    - *All Systems + Multi-Band > All Systems > Standard GPS*
    - Avoid using SatIQ because it causes the speed accuracy to deteriorate.
  - **Sony**
    - *GPS + Galileo > GPS + BeiDou > GPS + GLONASS > Standard GPS*
  - **MediaTek**
    - *GPS + Galileo > GPS + GLONASS > Standard GPS*
- Use the recording frequency of "every second".
- Ensure the phone is automatically updating its time from the network.
