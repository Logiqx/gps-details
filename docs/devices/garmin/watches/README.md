## Garmin Watches

### Overview

The GNSS chipset is probably the most significant factor when it comes to the accuracy and reliability of GPS watches. Additional factors include antenna design, GNSS firmware, watch firmware, and user settings. The activity mode and / or app choice are also really important.

This page lists the GNSS chipsets of the many Garmin watches that people may wish to use for GPS-Speedsurfing (GP3S). The information is intended for people choosing a Garmin watch, or curious about the suitability of their current watch.



### Recommended Watches

When choosing a Garmin watch it is highly recommended that you choose a model which incorporates an Airoha GNSS chipset. The speeds from the AIroha chipset are a lot more trustworthy than earlier watches, especially the ones using a Sony GNSS chipset.

There are numerous Garmin watches that incorporate the Airoha AG3335M (multi-band GNSS) or AG3335MN (single-band GNSS). The following sections list all of the Airoha-based Garmin watches that you might wish to consider for wind sports.
