## Garmin Watches

### Overview

This page lists the GPS / GNSS chipsets that are used in the various Garmin watches.

Chipsets for more recent watches have often been obtained from teardowns, reviews, or via deduction.

Chipsets for older watches have been obtained from a variety of sources, including [fellrnr.com](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/GPS_Accuracy-summary) and [test results](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/psdyxm93y2m12j3/AABNlbBRsF2E3edvzqnnMPC4a?dl=0&preview=Test+Results+-+All+Watches.xlsx) by Mark Gee.
