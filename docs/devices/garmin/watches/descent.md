## Garmin Descent

### Overview

This page lists the GNSS chipsets that are used in the Garmin Descent watches.

The Descent watches are primarily dive computers, but they are also suitable for "on the water" activities.

The various models are listed in reverse-chronological order. The release dates are generally from Garmin announcements.



### TBC

The Descent G2 was released after the [fÄ“nix 8](fenix.md), so may use an Airoha or Synaptics GNSS chipset.

The software version is the same as the Descent Mk3i so perhaps it also uses an Airoha chipset, albeit the single-band AG3335MN.
