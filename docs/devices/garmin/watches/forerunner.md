### Overview

This page lists the GPS / GNSS chipsets that are used in the Garmin Forerunner watches.

The various models are listed in reverse-chronological order. The release dates are generally from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmin_Forerunner#Release_history).

Chipsets for older watches have been obtained from a variety of sources, including [fellrnr.com](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/GPS_Accuracy-summary) and [test results](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/psdyxm93y2m12j3/AABNlbBRsF2E3edvzqnnMPC4a?dl=0&preview=Test+Results+-+All+Watches.xlsx) by Mark Gee.

Notes:

- The Fenix 7X uses the AG3335MN (confirmed by [tear down](http://www.f-blog.info/garmin-fenix-7x-solar-teardown-non-destructive/)) so it seems likely that it will also be in the Forerunner 165.
  - [AG3335M](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/A0Dmm0pijWW3MScb) is dual-frequency (L1 + L5) but has no support the NavIC
  - AG3335MN is single-frequency but supports L5 for NavIC / IRNSS.

- There is a new generation single-frequency [AG3352](https://www.airoha.com/products/p/zy4r082hgNywp1bg) on the Airoha website, which could be used in future watches.
