## Garmin Advice for Speed Sailors

### Introduction

This article will focus specifically on the Garmin range

The problem with max speeds, popular at all levels... most prone to errors

The GNSS chipset is probably the most significant factor when it comes to the accuracy and reliability of GPS watches. Additional factors include antenna design, GNSS firmware, watch firmware, and user settings. The activity mode and / or app choice are also really important.

Important factors to avoid speed sailing roulette, plus additional tips:

- Watch choice - GNSS chipset, general features
- Watch setup - firmware, settings, applications, and accounts
- Watch usage - wearing the watch, recording an activity, additional tips
- Data analysis - reviewing results, exporting + importing activities

Until earlier this year, I'd have advised against a Garmin

Last couple of years, good watches started to appear



### Watch Choice

#### GNSS Chipset

- GNSS chipset is a primary factor
  - pre-2012 = SiRF
  - 2012 to 2018 = MediaTek
  - 2019 to 2021 = Sony (and Jan-Feb 2022 for the Instinct 2 and Venu 2 Plus)
    - Repeated speeds
    - Spikes after loss of lock
  - 2022 onwards = Airoha (except Jan-Feb 2022 for the Instinct 2 and Venu 2 Plus
    - Decent data when using the right firmware, settings, activity / application
    - Can be pretty terrible data if you get these things wrong!



#### General Features

Activity profiles / applications
- Windsurfing application, APPro Windsurf, GPSTC V4
- I've reviewed every other application

Things to consider:
- Satellite systems (Multi-Band, All Systems, GPS + Galileo / GPS + GLONASS)
- AMOLED display
- HR monitor
- Buttons or touchscreen (e.g. vívoactive / Venu)
- Battery life

Mileage might vary... excuse the pun!


#### Recommendations


Cheapest
- Forerunner 165 £250 (GPSTC, no APro or wsurf)
- vívoactive 5 £260 (APPro + wsurf, no GPSTC)

Airoha
fēnix 8, fēnix E, fēnix 7, epix (Gen 2), quatix 7, tactix 7 ... Instinct 2X (no apps)
Forerunner 165/255/265/955/965, Enduro 3, Enduro 2, vívoactive 5, Venu Sq 2, Venu 3
n.b. 165/265 and Venu 3 not supported by APPro Windsurf. Venu Sq. 2 not by Windsurfing App

Sony
fēnix 6, quatix 6, tactix Delta ... Instinct Solar, Instinct Esports, Instinct 2
Forerunner 45/55/158/245/745/945, Enduro, vívoactive 4, Venu, Venu Sq, Venu 2, Venu 2 Plus
IGNORE the Sony models!

MediaTek
fēnix [2/3/Chronos/5], epix, quatix [3/5], tactix [Bravo/Charlie] ... Instinct

n.b. fēnix® Chronos is too posh. Unsure if vívoactive HR is supported by the apps but no Galileo

Recommended watches from 2015 onwards, due to MT3333 and app support:
  fēnix® 3, fēnix® 5, quatix® 3, quatix® 5, tactix® Bravo, tactix® Charlie
  Forerunner [645/935], vívoactive® 3 - Galileo + both apps

#### Accounts

- Link to Garmin Connect to GP3S, Hoolan, Waterspeed



### Watch Usage

#### Wearing the Watch

- How to wear - over wetsuit, back hand, not underhand

#### Recording an Activity

What is the latest GPS data?

Activity profiles / filters - SUP example

Use windsurfing (or other) activity profile, or recommended application.

#### Additional Tips

- Find my phone



### Data Analysis

#### Reviewing Results

Ignore max and take 2s with a pinch of salt, compare to 10s / 100m / 250m

GPSResults, GpsarPro, GPS Speedreader

#### Exporting Activities

- Export FIT

#### Importing Activities

- Import to suitable platform
  - GP3S using FIT
  - Ignore Strava and SportsTrackLive
    - Don't know about Relive which is also popular



### Known Issues

Firmware in 2022, but fixed some time before 2024

GPX



### Summary

Choose an Airoha watch, set it up properly

Use  windsurfing (or other) activity profile, or recommended application

Be mindful of the pitfalls when exporting and importing sessions. Use FIT.

Known issues.

Sail fast, and have fun!
