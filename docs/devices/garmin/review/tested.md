## Garmin Testing

### Overview

The vast majority of my testing has been on the Forerunner 255.

- APPro Windsurf -  windsurf activity profile, all systems and multi-band.
- Windsurfing Application - windsurf activity profile, multi-band.
- GPSTC - generic activity profile (aka "other"), all systems and multi-band.

Just recently, I have also tested the following devices:

- EPIX Pro (gen 2) - native windsurfing activity <sup>1</sup> and Windsurfing Application.
- Fenix 7 Pro Sapphire Solar - APPro Windsurf.

Both the EPIX Pro and Fenix 7 Pro have performed just as well as the Forerunner 255.

Note <sup>1</sup> the native Garmin windsurfing activity reports very weird / incorrect 10s results! 



### Summary

This document is being written when I don't have much time, so I will not present specific test results.

I will summarise the results as follows:

- The Forerunner 255 has produced solid results during all sessions - Apr to Dec 2024.
  - It was during this testing when I discovered that standard GPS can behave poorly.
  - Lengthy investigations into the various activity profiles were also undertaken.
  - TLDR - Only use the activity profiles called windsurf, kiteboard, and other.
- The EPIX Pro and Fenix 7 Pro have performed just as well as the Forerunner 255.
- The majority of testing has been using all systems, which has performed very well.
