## Garmin Integrations

### Overview

Multiple third party websites have integrations with Garmin Connect. You can therefore link your accounts and have your watersports activities uploaded directly to your favorite websites:

- GPS-Speedsurfing.com
- Hoolan
- Waterspeed
- Strava

It is worth mentioning that Strava ignores Doppler speeds and re-calculates speeds from the positional data. As such, speeds calculated by Strava should not be trusted, even for the Airoha-based watches. Strava can be thought of as a handy diary with a nice colorful map, but untrustworthy for speeds.
