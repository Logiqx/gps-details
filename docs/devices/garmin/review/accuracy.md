## Garmin Accuracy

### Summary

I don't have much time right now and can't write up all of my test results, so I will summarise:

- When set up correctly and used correctly, they often produce 2s results that are within 0.1 kts of the Motions but usually within 0.3 knots
  - I don't recall ever seeing more than 0.5 knots difference for 2s.
- Over longer distances the results are typically within 0.1 or 0.2 kts, when compared against the Motion.
- Spikes can occur but I've never seen them impact results, and they are caught by acceleration filters.
  - n.b. I do all of my testing in GPSResults and GPS SPeedreader with all of the filters switched off.
- There are a few observations that I consider to be minor [niggles](niggles.md) and described on another page.
