## Garmin Review

### Introduction

During 2024, I have been reviewing the performance of Garmin watches and their suitability for wind sports.

These pages have been created to share a variety of observations and pertinent technical details.

Since there are so many topics to cover, multiple pages have been created to avoid one giant summary!



### Background

Early in 2002, I had a look at the data coming out of several Garmin watches; Forerunner 255, fenix 7 and fenix 7S. All of these watches had issues with the speed data, despite using the windsurfing mode (fenix) or other (Forerunner 255). A somewhat brief summary of the issue can be found on Seabreeze in the topic "[Garmin Fenix 7](https://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Windsurfing/Gps/Garmin-Fenix-7?page=2)" on 25 Apr 2022 6:13 AM.

Fast forward to 2024 and TBWonder (Andrew Haigh) posted some [impressive test results](https://www.seabreeze.com.au/forums/Windsurfing/Gps/Garmin-255-vs-Mini-Motion-vs-ESP-logger) from his Forerunner 255. I decided to buy myself a Forerunner 255 and I have been testing it ever since. Not only have the original issues been resolved but coincidentally, COROS have introduced the Garmin issue of 2022 to their Airoha-based watches in 2024!



### General Overview

Before diving into any technical details, I will quickly summarise the Forerunner 255 as follows:

- Accuracy is far greater than any previous Garmin watches. 5 x 10s averages and longer runs are typically within 1 or 2 of tenths of a knot, relative to Motion / ESP benchmarks.
- Max speed is best ignored, but max 2s is typically within 2 or 3 tenths of a knot, relative to Motion / ESP benchmarks. Sometimes it is higher, sometimes it is lower but on average slightly lower.
- In my opinion, the results allow for reasonably fair competition for the likes of GPS-Speedsurfing and GPS Team Challenge. I don't consider it up to an ISWC World Championship event, but it's a solid performer recreationally.
- There are several apps / datafields that are worth using on the modern Garmin watches. These include APPro Windsurf, Windsurfing Application, and GPSTC V4.
- The integration of Garmin Connect with websites such as GPS-Speedsurfing, Hoolan, and Waterspeed is really handy. Sessions can be automatically posted to these third party websites.
- Battery life is pretty decent on the Garmin watches and a massive improvement on the Locosys GW-60 which needed to be charged prior to every session.  
- I have recommended the Forerunner 255 to numerous friends who want a GPS watch which is reliable and value for money. I've never had cause to suspect inaccurate results from their watches.



### Important Observations

Various observations have been made whilst testing Garmin devices.

- Firstly, it is the Airoha GNSS chipset which makes the modern watches perform so well. 
- The default recording interval on Garmin watches is "smart", and needs to be changed to "every second".
- GNSS settings are important - standard GPS can really suck on watches from Garmin (and COROS).
- Activity profiles are also really important
  - Windsurf, kiteboard, and other are suitable for speed sailing.
  - Surf, SUP, sailing and boating are unsuitable for speed sailing.

- Apps get to choose their GNSS setting and activity profile, so it is crucial that they do it correctly!
