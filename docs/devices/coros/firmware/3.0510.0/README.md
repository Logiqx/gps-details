## 3.0510.0 - 2 Aug 2024 or 18 Jun 2025

### Overview

Confusingly, the version number for 3.0510 was re-used for different watches almost one year apart.

- 2 Aug 2024 = APEX 2 / APEX  2 Pro / VERTIX 2 / VERTIX 2S
- 18 Jun 2025 = APEX Pro and VERTIX

The 3.0510.0 release in Aug 2024 had issues because the speedsurfing activity behaved much like windsurfing, which is non-doppler and thus prone to spikes.

It has been observed that 3.0510.0 behaves in exactly the same way as [3.0508.0](../3.0508.0/README.md) and [3.0506.0](../3.0506.0/README.md) on the APEX 2 / APEX  2 Pro / VERTIX 2 / VERTIX 2S and thus it has the same issues. Most of the time it isn't a huge problem on the newer watches, but it is nevertheless an issue.

The APEX Pro and VERTIX have the Sony GNSS chipset and the use of non-Doppler speeds is a much bigger issue. Large errors will often occur with this firmware and can boost 2s speeds by several knots, without it being obvious to the rider.
