## 3.0510.0 - 2 Aug 2024

### Overview

The 3.0510.0 release in Aug 2024 exhibits issues because speedsurfing behave much like windsurfing, which is non-doppler and thus prone to spikes.

This release behaves in exactly the same way as [3.0508.0](../3.0508.0/README.md) and [3.0506.0](../3.0506.0/README.md) thus has the same issues.
