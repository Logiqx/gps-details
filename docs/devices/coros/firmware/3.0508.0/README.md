## 3.0508.0

### Overview

The 3.0508.0 release in Jul / Aug 2024 exhibits issues because speedsurfing behaves much like windsurfing, which is non-doppler and thus prone to spikes. It was the first release for the APEX Pro and VERTIX to include the changes of [3.0506.0](../3.0506.0/README.md) which made the issues apparent.

The non-Doppler speed issues of 3.0506.0 and 3.0508.0 were [documented](../../doppler/README.md) on 19 Aug 2024.
