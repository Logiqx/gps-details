## 3.0808.0 - 15 Jan 2025

### Overview

3.0808.0 has been tested on the VERTIX 2 and APEX 2 Pro.

- The VERTIX 2 now works properly and the issues of firmware 3.07xx.0 + 3.04xx.0 have been resolved.
- The APEX 2 Pro continues to work properly, just like it did with firmware 3.07xx.0.

The VERTIX 2S and APEX 2 have not been tested, but are assumed to perform just like the VERTIX 2 and APEX 2 Pro.

### Quick Test

3 laps of a short test circuit were driven in a relatively open-sky environment. The total distance was almost exactly 5 km.

- The VERTIX 2 and APEX 2 Pro were both running firmware 3.0808.0.
- Motion 825 was recording at 5 Hz.

At the end of the test drive the data from the APEX 2 Pro and VERTIX 2 were compared to the motion. The speeds during one of the laps is shown in the screenshot below.

This quick visual check is enough to confirm that the filtering issues that affected firmware 3.07xx.0 on the VERTIX 2 (and firmware 3.04xx.0 on both watches) have been resolved.
