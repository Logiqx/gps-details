## 3.0309.0

### Overview

The 3.0309.0 release in Jan 2024 exhibits the original / accepted behavior.

However, unique to the COROS is the temporal offset issue on the APEX 2, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2 which causes [fantasy alphas](../../alpha/README.md).

Owners of an APEX Pro or VERTIX with firmware 3.050x.0 (released Aug 2024) are encouraged to downgrade to 3.0309.0.

If you wish to install 3.0309.0 on your APEX Pro or VERTIX then written [instructions](install.md) are now available!
