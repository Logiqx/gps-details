## COROS Firmware - Downgrading

### Background

The speedsurfing mode on the APEX Pro and VERTIX has been broken since firmware 3.050x.0 which was released in Aug 2024.

Owners of the APEX Pro and VERTIX are encouraged to downgrade to an earlier version of the firmware - e.g. 3.0308.0.



### Downgrading

The instructions have been removed from the COROS website, but can still be found thanks to the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240529091448/https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/15344945273620-How-to-manually-update-my-COROS-watch).

For convenience the instructions are provided here as well.
