## COROS Advice for Speed Sailors

### Introduction

This article will focus specifically on the COROS range

The problem with max speeds, popular at all levels... most prone to errors

The GNSS chipset is probably the most significant factor when it comes to the accuracy and reliability of GPS watches. Additional factors include antenna design, GNSS firmware, watch firmware, and user settings. The activity mode and / or app choice are also really important.

Important factors to avoid speed sailing roulette, plus additional tips:

- Watch choice - GNSS chipset, general features
- Watch setup - firmware, settings, and accounts
- Watch Usage - wearing the watch, recording an activity, plus additional tips
- Data analysis - reviewing results, exporting activities, and importing activities

Until COROS released watches there were limited options for speedsailing

Nice speedsurfing activity but they weren't perfect

Last couple of years, good watches started to appear



### Watch Choice

#### GNSS Chipset

- GNSS chipset is a primary factor
  - Early models used Sony
    - Repeated speeds
    - Low resolution / precision - unique to COROS
    - Spikes after loss of lock
  - Latest models use Airoha
    - Decent data when using the right firmware, settings, activity
    - Can be pretty  terrible data if you get these things wrong!

#### General Features

Records sats, HDOP, COG

Activity profiles

- Speedsurfing
- Windsurfing

Things to consider:

- Satellite systems (Multi-Band, All Systems, GPS + Galileo / GPS + GLONASS)
- HR monitor - improved in VERTIX 2S
- Battery life

Mileage might vary... excuse the pun!

#### Recommendations

- Choose Airoha - APEX 2, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2, VERTIX 2S
- Avoid Sony - APEX, APEX Pro, VERTIX



### Watch Setup

#### Firmware

TODO

#### Settings

- GPS - mode - all systems or dual frequency
- Gesture backlight - off
- Touch screen - off
- Auto lock - Standby mode + Activity mode - hold to unlock
- Time auto-sync
  - https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/5859961688212-The-watch-is-not-displaying-the-correct-time
- WiFi - manual sync, downloading maps and firmware updates

#### Applications

COROS do not support 3rd part applications like Apple or Garmin



### Linking Accounts

#### GP3S

Link to Garmin Connect to GP3S

It knows how to process speeds correctly, when provided with  a FIT upload

Filters will remove the worst spikes, but other errors will still be present

#### Hoolan and Waterspeed

Link to Garmin Connect to Hoolan and Waterspeed

They know how to process speeds correctly, when provided with  a FIT upload



#### Strava and Relive

Link to Garmin Connect to Strava and Relive

They do not know how to process speeds correctly, even when provided with  a FIT upload

You will see bogus numbers recorded



### Watch Usage

#### Wearing the Watch

- How to wear - over wetsuit, back hand, not underhand
- Rinse under tap

#### Recording an Activity

What is the latest GPS data?

Activity profiles / filters - show example

Use speedsurfing mode, not windsurfing

#### Additional Tips

- Find my phone
- Backlight during night
- Camera control - Insta360 / GoPro
- Marking a waypoint - lost something!



### Data Analysis

#### Reviewing Results

Ignore max and take 2s with a pinch of salt, compare to 10s / 100m / 250m

GPSResults, GpsarPro, GPS Speedreader

#### Exporting Activities

- FIT vs GPX

Spikes are capped in exports

#### Importing Activities

- Import to suitable platform
  - GP3S using FIT
  - Ignore Strava and SportsTrackLive
    - Don't know about Relive which is also popular

- Waterspeed does not handle COROS GPX properly at this time



### Known Issues

Firmware since May 2024

Run detection

Alphas - watch / app and the actual data

- Temporal delay affecting position vs speed



### Summary

Choose an Airoha watch, set it up properly.

Use speedsurfing, not windsurfing

Be mindful of the pitfalls when exporting and importing sessions. Use FIT.

Known issues - firmware, stats and data

Sail fast, and have fun!
