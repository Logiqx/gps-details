## COROS APEX Pro / VERTIX

### Windsurfing

#### 3.05.0

Firmware 3.05.0 (red) appears to be using the positional data for speeds in windsurfing mode. Spikes are clearly evident when comparing to a 5 Hz [Motion GPS](https://www.motion-gps.com/motion/index.html) (blue).

This is undesirable because people within the wider community also use the windsurfing mode, which is prone to inaccuracies and spikes.

The Garmin vivoactive 4 (red) is capturing the speed data from the Sony GNSS chipset, and there are no spikes present.

The Garmin is working as well as can be expected for a watch using the Sony GNSS chipset, noting the propensity for repeated speeds / flat spots.

#### 3.0308.0

TODO:

- Test windsurfing using an APEX Pro that has been downgraded to 3.0308.0.

Expectations:

- 3.0308.0 is expected to exhibit identical behavior to 3.05.0.



#### 3.0508.0

The COROS APEX Pro (red) still appears to be using the positional data for speeds, exhibiting somewhat elevated maximum speeds.

This is undesirable because people within the wider community also use the windsurfing mode, prone to inaccuracies and spikes.

The Garmin vivoactive 4 (red) is capturing the speed data from the Sony GNSS chipset, which is better than the positional data.

The Garmin is working as well as can be expected for a watch using the Sony GNSS chipset, noting the propensity for repeated speeds / flat spots.
