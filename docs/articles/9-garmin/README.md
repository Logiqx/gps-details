### Introduction

I'm often asked for GPS watch recommendations, so I've decided to create a resource focusing on Garmin products. It's a great time to be buying a GPS watch for watersports because there are some really great choices, whatever your budget.

Prior to early 2023, reliable GPS / GNSS performance was only available from dedicated loggers, and smart watches were somewhat unreliable for measuring speeds. It's only since mid-2023 that this situation began to change, primarily due to latest GNSS chipsets and firmware.

This guide will not discuss any of the technicalities relating to GPS / GNSS accuracy. It will simply focus on watches that provide decent performance and good value for money. Budget will typically dictate suitable choices, but there are several factors to consider.

- **GNSS chipset** - dictates accuracy and must be multi-band if posting to [GPS-Speedsurfing](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/) or [GPS Team Challenge](https://www.gpsteamchallenge.com.au/)
- **Ruggedness** - running watches are typically cheaper and lighter, but less robust and with lower water resistance
- **Screen type** - decide whether you prefer [MIP or AMOLED](https://lifehacker.com/health/which-is-better-smart-watch-display-mip-vs-amoled)
- **Watch size** - bigger watches suit bigger wrists, but have larger screens and longer battery life
- **Flashlight** - amazing feature that you never knew you needed, until you had it…

This page includes a quick comparison, summaries for individual watches, and links to further information.

- **Forerunner** - lightweight running watches, resistent to 5 ATM, without flashlight
- **Instinct, fēnix and epix** - rugged watches, resistent to 10 ATM, with flashlight

Whilst choosing a watch, you may also benefit from my [Garmin advice](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/guidance/garmin/) and list of [Garmin models](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-details/devices/garmin/watches/).



### Quick Comparison

This table should help you to identify suitable Garmin watches within your budget. The prices are for the UK because that is easiest for me to Google!

### fēnix 7 Pro

![fenix-7-Pro-Series-768x467](img/fenix-7-Pro-Series-768x467.jpg)

The fēnix 7 Pro has been superseded by the fēnix 8, but discounted prices make it excellent value for money.

There is a standard edition with Power Glass™ screen and stainless steel bezel, or sapphire edition with Sapphire crystal screen and titanium bezel. The non-Pro versions of fēnix 7 do not support multi-band GNSS, so the Instinct 3 AMOLED may be a better choice.

There are three sizes of the fēnix Pro; 7S (42 mm), 7 (47 mm) and 7X (51 mm). These are the specifications for 47 mm.

**Price**

- £579.99 RRP, currently £525 at John Lewis

**Size**

- 47 x 47 x 14.5 mm
- 33 mm (1.3″) display, 260 x 260 pixels

**Battery**

- Smartwatch mode: Up to 18 days / 22 days with solar
- All systems GNSS mode: Up to 40 hours / 48 hours with solar
- All systems GNSS mode + multi-band: Up to 23 hours / 26 hours with solar

### epix Pro (Gen 2)

![epix-Pro-Series-768x446](img/epix-Pro-Series-768x446.jpg)

The epix Pro (Gen 2) is essentially a fēnix 7 Pro with an AMOLED display.

There is a standard edition with Corning® Gorilla® Glass screen and stainless steel bezel, or sapphire edition with Sapphire crystal screen and titanium bezel. The non-pro versions of epix (Gen 2) do not support multi-band GNSS, so the Instinct 3 AMOLED may be a better choice.

There are three sizes of the epix Pro (Gen 2); 42 / 47 / 51 mm. These are the specifications for 47 mm.

**Price**

- £739.99 RRP, currently £509 at John Lewis

**Size**

- 47 x 47 x 14.5 mm
- 33 mm (1.3″) display, 416 x 416 pixels

**Battery**

- Smartwatch mode: Up to 16 days (6 days always-on)
- All systems GNSS mode: Up to 32 hours (24 hours always-on)
- All systems GNSS mode + multi-band: Up to 20 hours (15 hours always-on)

### Related Models

The quatix 7 (Solar and Pro) and tactix 7 (AMOLED) are almost identical to the fēnix 7 Pro and epix Pro, but they have not seen such big discounts as the various fēnix 7 Pro and epix Pro models.

If your budget stretches to the fēnix 8, it will be more suitable for scuba diving. It also adds voice commands and new software / user interface, but carries a hefty price tag at over £850. Likewise for the tactix 8 and probably the forthcoming quatix 8.

The Enduro 2 and Enduro 3 are essentially a modified fēnix 7X - Sapphire, but aimed at ultra-runners due to the impressive battery life. The Enduro 3 also has the newer software / user interface of the fēnix 8.

The Forerunner 275 and 975 are expected to be released in the near future, perhaps in May 2025. The Forerunner 265 and 965 are likely to be heavily discounted once they have been superseded, so look out for some bargains!



### Summary

The watches described on this page all use an Airoha GNSS chipset, which makes their performance superior to earlier models. This is why the guide does not discuss models such as the Forerunner 245 / 945 and Instinct 2 (not to be confused with 2X) which used a Sony GNSS chipset.

The Forerunner watches are lightweight and have a water rating of 5 ATM, whilst the Instinct + fēnix + epix are rugged watches with a water rating of 10 ATM. The rugged watches also have a built-in flashlight which nobody expects to need, but everyone loves!

Ultimately your budget and personal preferences will guide you to one or two possible Garmin watches. There may then be multiple sizes / colors / materials, music storage, and solar options to consider. Hopefully this guide has helped to point you in the right direction?
