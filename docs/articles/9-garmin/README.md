### What else?

The quatix 7 (Solar and Pro) and tactix 7 (AMOLED) are essentially the same as the fēnix 7 Pro and epix Pro, but they have not been discounted in the same way.

The fēnix 8 is more suitable for scuba diving, adds voice command and a new interface but carries a hefty price tag. Likewise for the tactix 8 and maybe the (yet to be released) quatix 8.

The Enduro 2 and Enduro 3 are akin to the fēnix 7X - Sapphire Solar but with longer battery life. The Enduro 3 also has the newer software interface like the fēnix 8.

The Forerunner 275 and 975 is expected to be released in the near future (maybe in May 2025), which will no doubt mean the Forerunner 265 and 965 being discounted.
